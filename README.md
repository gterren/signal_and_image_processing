# Signal and Image Processing

See articles https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12401.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08694.pdf for further information about the signal and image professing implemented in ground-based infrared sky images.

## Pyranometer Signal Processing

## Infrared Images Processing

### Moist Adiabatic Lapse Rate

See file in moist_adiabatic_lapse_rate.ipynb.

### Atmospheric Radiometric Model

### Atmospheric Conditions Model

See files in the directory: atmospheric_condition_model/*

The files in this folder include the jupyter notebooks used in the analysis of the fetures and the analysis of the results. The .py files were used in the High Performance Computer to cross-validate the parameters of the model. The features were quantified as statistics or histogram bins (See .py files in repository).

### Outdoor Germanium Camera Window Model

## Dataset

A sample dataset is publicaly available in DRYAD repository: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.zcrjdfn9m
